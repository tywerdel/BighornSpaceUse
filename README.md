# BighornSpaceUse

This code was used in analyses for:

**Werdel, T.J.**, J.A. Jenks, J.T. Kanta, C.P. Lehman, and T.J. Frink. Space use and movement patterns of translocated bighorn sheep. Mammalian Biology ([https://DOI:10.1007/s42991-021-00107-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42991-021-00107-4)).

[BighornHomeRanges.R](https://github.com/tywerdel/BighornSpaceUse/blob/main/BighornHomeRanges.R) includes R code to determine MCP and KDE home range estimates.

[BighornMoveCodeNew.R](https://github.com/tywerdel/BighornSpaceUse/blob/main/BighornMoveCodeNew.R) includes R code to determine GPS collar activity, movement, and BBMM home range estimates.

The included .csv files are referenced in the code, and their inclusion will allow you to reproduce the analyses used in the manuscript.

These specific codes were some of my first experiences with R, so they are not the most efficient, but they get the job done.
